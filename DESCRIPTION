Title: miRNAtap: microRNA Targets - Aggregated Predictions
Version: 1.31.0
Date: 2016-10-03
Author: Maciej Pajak, T. Ian Simpson
Maintainer: T. Ian Simpson <ian.simpson@ed.ac.uk>
Description: The package facilitates implementation of workflows
    requiring miRNA predictions, it allows to integrate ranked
    miRNA target predictions from multiple sources available online
    and aggregate them with various methods which improves quality
    of predictions above any of the single sources. Currently
    predictions are available for Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and
    Rattus norvegicus (the last one through homology translation).
